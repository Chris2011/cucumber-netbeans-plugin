== History

<b>New in Version 1.2.0 (12th June 2009)</b>

* Integration into NetBeans (File->New File)
* Template File
* Code Folding for Scenario, Background and Examples
* Major code changes

<b>New in Version 1.1.9 (11th June 2009)</b>

== Next Goals

* Multiline Descriptions (available in Version 1.1.9, temporally removed through structural changes)
* Indentation (currently only available for Feature, not for Scenarios)
* Tooltips
* Language Support (currenty English and French[alpha-status] )
* ... propose something ... :-)

== Language Support

As Cucumber supports multiple languages, I also want to support multiple languages, but as this is not so easy and needs some work, I'll only supply which are really needed and requested from other people.

<b> How to request this module supporting a different language </b>

Open an issue and write down a translation list of terms like in the example below and provide a sample .feature-File with is written is this language and includes all of the features of cucumber.

<b> Example:</b>

<table>
<tr>
<th>EN</th>
<th>your requested language</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feature</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In order to</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>As a</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I want to</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scenario</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scenario Outline</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Given</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Then</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Examples</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Background</td>

</table>

<b> if there are more then ? People, where ? is not decided jet, i'll start translating it. </b>
