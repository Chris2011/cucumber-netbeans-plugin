<h1>Cucumber Features : Netbeans Module</h1>

<h2>Install</h2>
	
# Download file info-cukes-feature.nbm:
## from the build directory using GIT
## OR from my "modules":http://members.chello.at/server/modules.html page on my webpage
## OR from the "Netbeans Plugins":http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/faces/PluginDetailPage.jsp?pluginid=17939
# Open NetBeans and go to Tools -> Plugins
# In the Plugins dialog click on the "Downloaded" tab
# Click "Add Plugins..."
# Browse to where ever you downloaded the .nbm file, select it and click "Open"
# Last, click on "Install".


<h2>Usage</h2>

Create a new empty file with .feature ending and start editing.

OR

Go to File -> New File and choose 'Cucumber' and 'FeatureTemplate.feature'

<h3>Changing Colors</h3>

Since Version 1.2.2 it is possible to customize the colors so that you can use your own preferred ones.

# Go to Tools -> Options -> Miscellaneous
# Select "Cucumber Feature Options"
# Select your Colors:
## press "Choose" of the desired option
## select your desired color
## press "Okay"
# Save them by pressing "Okay"
# Restart NetBeans

You have to restart netbeans, since the colors for the module are loaded only once at the start of NetBeans

More customizations like bold or italic will follow soon.

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<b>I have messed up the colors and now I want to have the default colors</b>

On Windows: Go to C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\.netbeans\<netbeans_version>\config\Preferences\info\cukes and delete the 'feature.properties' file

On Linux: Go to ~/.netbeans/<netbeans_version>/config/Preferences/info/cukes and delete the 'feature.file'

Restart NetBeans afterwards.

<h2>Language Support</h2>

As Cucumber supports multiple languages, I also want to support multiple languages, but as this is not so easy and needs some work, I'll only supply which are really needed and requested from other people.

<b> How to request this module supporting a different language </b>

Open an issue and write down a translation list of terms like in the example below and provide a sample .feature-File with is written is this language and includes all of the features of cucumber.

<b> Example:</b>

<table>
<tr>
<th>EN</th>
<th>your requested language</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feature</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In order to</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>As a</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I want to</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scenario</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scenario Outline</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Given</td>
