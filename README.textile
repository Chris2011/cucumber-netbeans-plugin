* Tooltips

<h2>Language Support</h2>

As Cucumber supports multiple languages, I also want to support multiple languages, but as this is not so easy and needs some work, I'll only supply which are really needed and requested from other people.

<b> How to request this module supporting a different language </b>

Open an issue and write down a translation list of terms like in the example below and provide a sample .feature-File with is written is this language and includes all of the features of cucumber.

<b> Example:</b>

<table>
<tr>
<th>EN</th>
<th>your requested language</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Feature</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In order to</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>As a</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I want to</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scenario</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scenario Outline</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Given</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>

<td>And</td>
<td>...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Examples</td>
